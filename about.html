              Hey! My name's Anhelina Allakhverdova. I am a passionate dancer and choreographer from Kherson, Ukraine. I bring energy, rhythm, and creativity to everything I do.

            <p>
              I am currently in Klaipeda, Lithuania, developing here as a dancer and choreographer.

            <p>
              I am a student at LCC International University majoring in Contemporary Communications. Also, I am studying at Yaroslav the Wise National University of Law, majoring in Ukrainian Law with a specialisation in prosecution.

              I have been dancing for 13 years. I am very proficient in styles such as hip hop and contemporary, but also have experience in vogue, popping, waacking, locking, classical, and folk dance. I am currently a member of the adult team at Motus Imperium Dance Studio. I am competing on both the Lithuanian and global stages. I ve honed the art of storytelling through movement, creating powerful performances that resonate with audiences. I see my dance journey as a fusion of dedication, discipline, and innovation, with each competition fuelling my growth as an artist.

              Beyond the stage, I apply this creative discipline to other realms: from designing engaging English lessons as a private tutor to crafting compelling digital content and fundraising campaigns for causes I believe in. With an adaptable mindset and a commitment to quality, I thrive in collaborative spaces while leading projects that require both focus and flair.

              In August 2023, I joined the non-government organisation Opir which is dedicated to mobilising individuals from around the world to support Ukraine and raise awareness about the ongoing conflict. In my capacity as a volunteer, I contribute as a content maker, journalist, SMM specialist, and copywriter.

             I follow the opinion that nothing is impossible; you just need to have a deep desire to achieve your goal.
